# hot-chee-to

Why is this called hot-chee-to? Seems like a weird name.

Well, I owned the domain chee.to for a short period of time before my registrar refunded my payment and took back the domain so they could relist it with a higher price. The plan was to make the domain hot.chee.to which I thought would be really cool. Since I couldn't make it hot.chee.to I made it 3co.app instead which I think is pretty cool as well.
