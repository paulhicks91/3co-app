# hot-chee-to

Why is this called hot-chee-to? Seems like a weird name.

Well, I owned the domain chee.to for a short period of time before my registrar refunded my payment and took back the domain so they could relist it with a higher price. The plan was to make the domain hot.chee.to which I thought would be really cool. Since I couldn't make it hot.chee.to I made it 3co.app instead which I think is pretty cool as well.

The goal is to create various Killer Queen Black

## How it works

The app is written in flask and deployed in [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)  

The database is Google BigQuery, data is uploaded to BigQuery from my local machine using the local_operations module, however, the goal is to create a portal where users can upload files themselves.

The schema for the main table, matchStats, is based on the layout of the JSON files generated by KQB. I wanted to preserve the raw data and only added a couple fields to log metadata like filename, submittedBy, matchTimestamp and createdTimestamp.
